;;; Requirements:

;; I tested in on GNU Emacs 22, but maybe it works with older emacsen or
;; XEmacs, too.  You need ImageMagick's convert tool.

;;; Commentary:

;; DocView is a  document viewer for Emacs.  It converts PDF,  PS and DVI files
;; to a set  of PNG files, one PNG  for each page, and displays  the PNG images
;; inside  an Emacs buffer.   This buffer  uses `doc-view-mode'  which provides
;; convenient key bindings for browsing the document.
;;
;; To use it simply do
;;
;;     M-x doc-view RET
;;
;; and you'll be queried for a document to open.
;;
;; Since  conversion may take  some time  all the  PNG images  are cached  in a
;; subdirectory of `doc-view-cache-directory' and  reused when you want to view
;; that  file again.   This  reusing can  be  omitted if  you  provide a  prefx
;; argument    to   `doc-view'.     To    delete   all    cached   files    use
;; `doc-view-clear-cache'.  To open the cache  with dired, so that you can tidy
;; it out use `doc-view-dired-cache'.
